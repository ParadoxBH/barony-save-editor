INSTRUCTIONS – BARONY SAVE EDITOR

The Barony Save Editor program was developed by ParadoxBH. This software is NOT official and may contain bugs or errors. It was created only to help with managing and editing Barony save files.

WHAT’S INSIDE THE ZIP FILE:
Inside the ZIP, there are save files separated for each player who was in the game session.
The files are named in the following format:

{player name}__{save file name}

Example:
Pedro__savegame3_mp.baronysave

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

Find the save file that belongs to your player.

Rename the file by removing the “{player name}__” part.
The name must be only the original save file name.

Example:
From → Pedro__savegame3_mp.baronysave
To → savegame3_mp.baronysave

WHERE TO PLACE THE FILE:
Put the renamed file in the following folder:

...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Barony\savegames

REQUIRED FILE NAMES FOR THE GAME TO RECOGNIZE THE SAVE:

Singleplayer:
savegame{number}.baronysave
Example: savegame1.baronysave

Multiplayer:
savegame{number}_mp.baronysave
Example: savegame2_mp.baronysave

IMPORTANT ABOUT EDITING WHILE THE GAME IS OPEN:
You do NOT need to close and reopen the game every time.
This process works as long as you are on the main menu screen, before the save selection screen.
Just make sure to return to the main menu before editing any save files in the folder.

After that, the save should appear as if it was created by the game itself.
If it doesn’t show up, try a different number in the file name or check if the file is in the correct folder.

Good luck and have fun!
